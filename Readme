IB Loan Desk Web App

Purpose: A toy web app to practice databases and web development. Interactive Brokers provides an FTP site with a frequently

Added July 8, a simple twitter bot (@IBorrowDesk) that responds to messages including a ticker symbol with a response
summarizing the fee, availability, and last update for the given stock.
