IB Loan Desk Web App

Purpose: A toy web app to practice databases and web development. Interactive Brokers provides an FTP site with a frequently
    updated csv file of their entire stock loan database with fees, rebates, and availability. The goal of this webapp
    is to provide some analytics for users to track trends in borrow fees and availability and eventually to receive
    automatic alerts on stocks they are interested in.
